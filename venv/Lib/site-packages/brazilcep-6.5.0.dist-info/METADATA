## About

**BrazilCEP** is a minimalist and easy-to-use python library designed to query CEP (Postal Address Code) data.

Its objective is to provide a common query interface to all these search services, facilitating the integration of Python applications with these services.

Currently supports several CEP API's:

- [ViaCEP](https://viacep.com.br)
- [ApiCEP (WideNet)](https://apicep.com)
- [OpenCEP](https://opencep.com/)

> [!NOTE]
> **BrazilCEP** is the new name of former **PyCEPCorreio** python library.
  If you want to migrate the old code to the new version, please see the [migrate](https://brazilcep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrate/) section in docs.

> [!TIP]
> **CEP** or **Código de Endereçamento Postal** (*Postal Address Code*), as it is also known, is a system of numeric codes, created, maintained and organized by *Correios do Brazil* for
> organizing addresses and deliveries of letters and parcels.


## Install

The recommended way to get BrazilCEP is to **install the latest stable release**
via [pip](http://pip-installer.org>):

```sh
pip install brazilcep
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We currently support **Python 3.8+ only**. Users on older interpreter versions are urged to upgrade.

## How to Use

Making a request is very simple. Begin by importing the BrazilCEP module:

```python
>>> import brazilcep
```

Now, call the `get_address_from_cep` to query any CEP:

```python
>>> address = brazilcep.get_address_from_cep('37503-130')
```

Now, we have a *dict* object called ``address``. We can
get all the address information we need from this object:

```python
 >>> address
{
    'district': 'rua abc',
    'cep': '37503130',
    'city': 'city ABC',
    'street': 'str',
    'uf': 'str',
    'complement': 'str',
}
```

The CEP always must be a string.

> [!TIP]
> BrazilCEP was developed to integrate on-demand queries into web pages.
> Querying CEP in bulk through scripts or any other means is not recommended.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> BrazilCEP is not responsible for the functioning, availability and support of any of these query API's.
> All of them are provided by third parties, and this library just provides a handy way to centralize the CEP search on these services.

## Documentation

Documentation for the current version of BrazilCEP is available from the official docs [here](https://brazilcep.readthedocs.io/en/stable).
